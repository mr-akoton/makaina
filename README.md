# Makaina

**Makaina** is a procedural terrain generator and explorer written in C++ using *OpenGL 3.3*.
It produces stylized, low-poly 3D landscapes and allows free camera movement to explore them in real time.

This project was built for learning purposes — to better understand how procedural generation and 3D rendering systems work together using modern OpenGL.

## 🧩 Features

# Core Functionality

- 🚧 **Procedural terrain generation** — Heightmap generated from noise
- 🚧 **Flat shading** — Distinct low-poly visual style
- 🚧 **Camera system** — Move and rotate freely in 3D space
- 🚧 **Configurable terrain parameters** — Scale, amplitude, noise frequency

# Potential Features

- ⏳ **Dynamic terrain loading** — Generate new chunks while exploring
- ⏳ **Vertex coloring** — Color terrain based on height or slope
- ⏳ **Water plane** — Add stylized low-poly water surface
- ⏳ **Lighting control** — Multiple light sources and time-of-day cycle

## 🚀 Getting Started

# Prerequisites

This application is developed and tested on Linux only. You may not be able to build it on another operating system.

You need:
- `C++17` or later
- `OpenGL 3.3` compatible GPU
- `GLFW` (installed on the system or built locally)
- `GLM` (manually placed in ./external/glm/)

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to:
- Deepen understanding of OpenGL’s rendering pipeline
- Explore procedural generation and noise functions
- Build a reusable base for small 3D experiments
- Learn good project structure and modern C++ practices
